          Add any thoughts you have on appropriate/necessary management. The AHIMS

          fencing/cage/barrier, closure to public, continued inspection, fire
          hazard reduction, expert assessment, meeting with land manager,
          revegetation, signage, soil erosion control, track closure/re-routing,
          rubbish removal, insect/animal removal additional recording,
          interpretation.
