# Module Dev Scripts

This directory contains small scripts related to module development.

## arch16N_cleaner.py

Given an arch16N.properties, ui_schema.xml and data_schema.xml file,
this script removes entries from the arch16n file which aren't used in either of the others.

## as.py

Replaces the arch16n _keys_ in one file with their _values_, from another, arch16n file.

The usage message can be seen by running it without arguments.

## sql2plot.py

Takes an sqlite database and a query returning two numerical columns, and plots the results. The first and
second columns are interpreted as the x and y axes, respectively.

This script's usage message can be seen by running it without arguments.

## upload.py

This script uploads a module to the dev server. When run without arguments, it looks for a module in
a directory called 'module', in the same directory as the script. The module's definition files
must have the same names as they would if they were generated by the autogen. These names are as follows:

| File purpose  | File name              |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Arch16n       | english.0.properties   |
| CSS           | ui_styling.css         |
| Data Schema   | data_schema.xml        |
| UI Logic      | ui_logic.bsh           |
| UI Schema     | ui_schema.xml          |
| Validation    | validation.xml         |
