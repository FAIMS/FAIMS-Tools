Quick Start
  1. Modify the example module.xml. If you see something there which you don't
     understand, check this file.
  2. Run `./generate.sh`
  3. Collect your new shiny new module from the 'module' directory.

Attributes
  b                  Binding (See 'Bindings')
  c                  Alias for faims_style_class
  f                  Flags (See 'Flags')
  l                  Link to tab or tab group in the format Tabgroup/Tab/
  p                  In <opt> tags, equivalent to pictureURL attribute. In <str>
                     tags, provides the position (ordering) of identifiers in a
                     fortmatted string.
  suppressWarnings   Prevents warnings from being shown when equal to "true" and
                     present in the <module> tag. Does not suppress errors.
  t                  Type of GUI element (See 'Types'). If this attribute is
                     omitted from a view, t="input" is assumed.

Bindings
  - decimal
  Other bindings are possible (e.g. by writing b = "string") but generate a
  warning.

  id              Equivalent to isIdentifier="true".
  noannotation    Equivalent to faims_annotation="false".
  nocertainty     Equivalent to faims_certainty="false".
  nolabel         Prevents labels from being displayed or generated from element
                  names.
  nosync          Removes the faims_sync="true" attribute from audio, camera,
                  file and video GUI elements.
  nothumb[nail]   Removes the thumbnail="true" attribute from audio, camera,
                  file and video elements in the data schema.
  notscrollable   Equivalent to faims_scrollable="false".
  onlydata        Only allows code to be generated for the data schema.

  notnull         Adds client- and server-side validation specifying that the
                  field should not be left blank.

Naming Conventions and Reserved Element Names
  "Reserved" elements only contain lower case letters:
    - <col>      One column in a <cols> tag
    - <cols>     Columns
    - <desc>     Description to put in the data schema
    - <module>
    - <opt>      Option in <opts> tag
    - <opts>     Options for, say, a dropdown menu
    - <rels>     Intended to be a direct child of <module> and hold
                 <RelationshipElement> tags
    - <str>      Contains <formatString>-related data.
    - <pos>      When the child of a <str>, gives the position (order) of an
                 identifier in a formatted string
    - <fmt>      When the child of a <str>, contains <formatString> data.
    - <app>      When the child of a <str>, contains <appendCharacterString>
                 data.
  User-defined elements should start with an upper case letter and use
  underscores as separators:
    - <My_User_Defined_Element t="dropdown" />
  Neither of these naming conventions are strictly enforced however.

Intended Purpose of The <rels> Tag
  When placed as a direct child of the <module> element, contents of the <rels>
  tag are copied as-is to the generated data schema. No warnings are shown if
  something is awry with its contents.

  Because the <rels> tags' contents are directly copied, in principle you could
  put anything in there which you want to appear in the data schema. This would
  make you a bad person.

Semantics of <cols> Tags
  Direct children of <cols> tags are interpreted as columns. For example,
      <cols>
         <Field_1 t="input"/>
         <Field_2 t="input"/>
         <Field_3 t="input"/>
      </cols>
  has three columns, each containing an input. The left-most column is Field_1,
  whereas the right-most is Field_3.

  When a <col> tag is a direct child, its contents are interpreted as being part
  of a distinct column. Therefore,
      <cols>
         <Field_1 t="input"/>
         <col>
           <Field_2 t="input"/>
           <Field_3 t="input"/>
         </col>
      </cols>
  results in two columns. The left column contains Field_1, while the right
  contains Field_2 and Field_3.

Labels
  An element's text is taken as its label. For instance, the following input
      <My_Input t="input">
        Droopy Soup
        <desc>Similar to drippy soup, but not quite...</desc>
      </My_Input>
  has the label "Droopy Soup". Note that following and preceding whitespace is
  stripped.

  If a label is not provided, it is inferred from the element's name. More
  specifically, underscores in the element's name are replaced with whitespace,
  which becomes the element's label. Therefore, the element
      <Droopy_Soup t="input">
        <desc>Similar to drippy soup, but not quite...</desc>
      </Droopy_Soup>
  has the same label as in the above example.

  You are recommended to use this feature, as it encourages consistency between
  the label, which the user sees, and the view's reference, which the programmer
  sees. Note that it merely "encourages" consistency as the programmer can
  change the corresponding, generated, arch16n (english.0.properties) entry.

Generation of The arch16n File
  Labels and menu options (e.g. from checkboxes and dropdowns) have arch16n
  entries generated for them. The left-hand side of an arch16n entry (i.e.
  everything to the left of the equals sign) is produced by changing all
  non-alphanumeric characters in the label or menu option to underscores. The
  right-hand side is the unmodified text.

  The created arch16n entries are used in the generated UI and data schemas.

  It should be carefully noted that replacing characters as described above can
  cause naming conflicts. For example, if the module contains the labels "I'm
  cool!" and "I'm cool?", the generated arch16n file will contain the following
  lines:
      I_m_cool_=I'm cool!
      I_m_cool_=I'm cool?
  Moreover, the programmer is not warned if such a conflict exists, as, in
  practise, it assumed that such conflicts are very rare and checking for them
  in XSLT 1.0 violates Article 5 of 'The Universal Declaration of Human Rights'.

Known Issues
  Arbitrarily nested group elements cannot be specified within a tab. For
  example, the following module is poorly defined:
      <?xml version="1.0" ?>
      <module>
        <Tab_Group>
          <Tab>
            <Field_1 t="group">
              <Field_2 t="group"/>  <!-- Well, *there's* your problem! -->
            </Field_1>
          </Tab>
        </Tab_Group>
      </module>
  Moreover, the programmer will not be warned about this and should expect un-
  expected behaviour.

Grammar
  The empty string is denoted by a period (.), comments begin with hash symbols
  (#), and \w is used to indicate an arbitrary tag name. Also, non-terminals and
  starting symbols are surrounded by backticks.
